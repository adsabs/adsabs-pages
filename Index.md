## Welcome to ADS Labs! 

The ADS team has been working hard on reinventing its services and interfaces to better support our community's research needs.  ADS Labs provides new interfaces built on the old tried-and-true **[ADS Abstract Databases](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/ads_abstracts.html)**, so all of ADS's content is available through them.

ADS Labs currently features three different interfaces that allow you to search, explore and visualize the contents of its 10 million bibliographic records and its 2.6 million full-text documents.
<html>
<div style="margin: -20px 30px 20px 30px">
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td style="padding-bottom:10px">
	<div class="btn" style="width:150px; margin-right:20px">
		<a href="/adsabs/">Integrated Search</a>
	</div>
   </td>
   <td style="vertical-align:middle;">
        <div><em>Search all abstracts and full-text content in the ADS (currently an alpha release)</em></div>
   </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td style="padding-bottom:10px">
	<div class="btn" style="width:150px; margin-right:20px">
		<a href="/ui/">Streamlined Search</a>
	</div>
   </td>
   <td style="vertical-align:middle;">
        <div><em>Search the 10M bibliographic records in ADS by author, title or keyword, visualize results</em></div>
   </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td style="padding-bottom:10px">
	<div class="btn" style="width:150px; margin-right:20px">
		<a href="/fulltext/">Full-Text Search</a>
	</div>
   </td>
   <td style="vertical-align:middle;">
        <div><em>Search the full-text of the 2.6M documents in the ADS article archive</em></div>
   </td>
   </tr>
   </table>
</div>

Each interface provides slightly different functionality, and while we are working to consolidate all search capabilities in the Integrated Search we are still providing access to the two other interfaces for the time being.  Some of the new features you will find include: *new ranking options* and support for *advanced searches*; *filtering of results* based on a variety of criteria; *interactive visualizations* of paper and author networks; *recommendations* and *notifications*; and *impact evaluation* via bibliometric summaries.

Please note that some of the features we are integrating in ADS Labs can also be accessed from **[a separate page](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/tools/).** These include the metrics service, the citation helper, and the author-affiliation service.  You may also be interested in keeping up with the ADS article of the day featured in **[our Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/nasaads).**
