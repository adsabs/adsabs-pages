How to search the ADS:

Our new one box search strings together queries for you.

Preset search options that are available for you include:  
  <li>Author  format: lastname, firstname middleinitial
  <li>First Author    format: lastname, firstname middleinitial
  <li>Title   searches text within title field
  <li>Year format YYYY or range YYYY-YYYY
  <li>Publication Use journal abbreviations from our bibstem list
  <li>Fulltext searches within the fulltext of articles
  
  You can string together any of the search terms to develop a query.  The default operator is AND but can be changed by specifying OR in the query.  Similarly one can exclude a term by prepending a "-" sign to it.
  
  The "+ options" button allows you to 
  <li>specify a publication date range to search in between (if you do not know the month you may use "00".)  
  <li>select a database:  astronomy, physics, general or all
  <li>disable fulltext
  <li> select articles only
  
  The search settings option allows you to select how many results to return (200 is the default)
