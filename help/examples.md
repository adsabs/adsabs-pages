##Filtering within facet##

Search for author: "Huchra, John" in the Astronomy database (default search).  
Opening the author filter you will get a list that includes "Geller, M" and "Illingworth, G."  If you want the articles in which "Geller, M." is a coauthor with "Huchra, John" you would simply click on the name "Geller, M." in the list.  
If you want the articles in which either "Geller, M." or "Illingworth, G" were coauthors you would click the boxes next to both of their names and choose "or" from the dropdown "apply" box.  
If you want the articles in which both "Geller, M." and "Illingworth, G" were coauthors you would click the boxes next to both of their names and choose "and" from the dropdown "apply" box.  (There should be zero results for this query!)
