## ABOUT THE ADS

The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is a Digital Library portal for researchers in Astronomy and Physics, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) under a NASA grant.

The ADS corpus consists of 10 million bibliographic records, 60 million citations, and close to 3 million full-text documents, the world's most complete collection of scholarly content in the physical sciences. All are cross-referenced through authors, citations, subjects, and astronomical objects.  Abstracts and the texts of major astronomy and physics journals are fully indexed and searchable through an easy to use interface that facilitates access for the professional and non-professional alike.

Integrated in its databases, the ADS provides access and pointers to a wealth of external resources, including electronic articles, data catalogs and archives. We currently have links to over 10 million resources maintained by our collaborators.
