#**Results list**#

A list of papers that match your initial query will be displayed and you will be able to further refine your query by using our "Limit Your Search" options or to view additional information about the articles that were returned.

Clicking on a   *>*   will detail your results for that filter.

##**Limit your search**##

Once you have a results list from an initial query you can use our filters to further refine your search.  Please note that your results list will change each time you apply a limit.  Each limit appears above the top of the results list and can be undone simply by clicking on the *x* in each box (or clearing all filters but chosing "Clear all."  Currently we have the following options available:

  * *Top papers*--here you can chose to limit your search to the first xxx results (where you chose the number xxx either by typing in the number or using the scroll bar.)  Hitting apply activates this option.  You may return to the original results by using the reset button.
  * *Authors*--here you may chose to limit your search to include or exclude individual authors.  To do this choose one or more authors and the *apply* function will activate.  Here you can choose to "and", "or" or "exclude" authors from your resulting list. 
  * *Database*--here you may chose to add results from the database(s) that were not selected in your original query.  You may also chose to exclude a database that was initially chosen.  
  * *Keywords*--here you may chose to narrow your results by including or excluding keywords that were found in the results of your original query.  
  * *Publications*--here you may chose to narrow your results by including or excluding journals that were found in the results of your original query. 
  * *Refereed status*--here you may chose to include or exclude refereed or non-refereed publications
  * *Bib Groups*--here you may chose to include or exclude results from different Bib Groups within the ADS
  * *Grants*--here you may chose to include or exclude results that reference grant numbers that were recognized in the original search
  * *Data*--here you may chose to include or exclude results that contain data in various archives (e.g. CDS, HEASARC, CXO, NED)
  * *Vizier Tables*--here you may chose to include or exclude articles that have Vizier Tables
  * *Publication Year*--here you may chose to limit your results to a specified time period by typing in the year range or using the provided slide bar

##**Understanding the Results**##

Your results are ranked according to your query and filtering options that you have applied.

**export** Working with the list you can select articles and export the resulting lists in various formats (e.g. to ADS Classic, Endnote, Bibtex or AAStex)

**sort**  You can also sort your results by date, by citation num or by popularity (all of these can be returned in ascending or descending order)

##**Article Lists**##
The ADS utilizes bibliographic codes (bibcodes) to identify literature in our database.  Using a standard bibliographic format, as explained below, we can easily identify different articles and users can efficiently search for them.
The bibliographic code is a 19 digit identifier which describes the journal article. The format was originally adopted by the SIMBAD and NED projects, and follows the syntax: 
YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA where: 

 * YYYY: Year of publication 
 * JJJJJ: A standard abbreviation for the journal (e.g. ApJ, AJ, MNRAS, Sci, PASP, etc.). A list of abbreviations is available. 
 * VVVV: The volume number (for a serial) or an abbreviation that specifies what type of publication it is (e.g. conf for conference proceedings, meet for Meeting proceedings, book for a book, coll for colloquium proceedings, proc for any other type of proceedings). 
 * M: Qualifier for publication:
    * E: Electronic Abstract (usually a counter, not a page number)
    * L: Letter
    * P: Pink page
   * Q-Z: Unduplicating character for identical codes 
 * PPPP: Page number. Note that for page numbers greater than 9999, the page number is continued in the m column. 
 * A: The first letter of the last name of the first author. 

The fields are padded with periods (.) so that the code is always 19 characters long. The journal is left-justified within its 5 characters, and the volume and page are right-justified. New journal abbreviations should be unique, and follow existing naming conventions. As an example, the bibliographic code: 
1992ApJ...400L...1W corresponds to the article: Astrophysical Journal Letters volume 400, page L1. 

###**Available links**###

Following each bibcode is a list of letters which indicate what data are available for the article.  

 * A	 (Abstract)	 Full abstract of the article. (These abstracts come from different sources)
 * C	 (Citations)	 A list of articles that cite the current article. (This list is not necessarily complete)
 * D	 (On-line Data)	 Links to on-line data at other data centers.
 * E	 (Electronic Article)	 Links to the on-line version of the article. These on-line versions are in HTML format for viewing on-screen, not for printing.
 * F	 (Printable Article)	 Links to on-line articles in PDF or Postscript format for printing.
 * G	 (Gif Images)	 Links to the images of scanned articles in the ADS Article Service.
 * H	 (HEP/Spires Information)	 Links to on-line articles at the HEP/Spires database.
 * I	 (Author Comments)	 Links to author supplied additional information (e.g. corrections, additional references, links to data, etc.)
 * L	 (Library Entries)	 Links to entries in the Library of Congress and other on-line library system.
 * M	 (Multimedia)	 Links to on-line presentations related to bibliographic record.
 * N	 (NED Objects)	 Access to the lists of objects for the current article in the NED database.
 * O	 (Associated Articles)	 A list of articles that are associated with the current article. These can be errata or other articles in a series.
 * P	 (Planetary Data System)	 Links to datasets at the Planetary Data System.
 * R	 (References)	 A list of articles referred to in the current article. For older articles these lists are not necessarily complete, they contain only references to articles that are in the ADS database. For some articles that are on-line in electronic form, the "R" link points to the on-line reference list, and therefore the complete list of references in that article.
 * S	 (SIMBAD Objects)	 Access to the lists of objects for the current article in the SIMBAD database.
 * T	 (Table of Contents)	 Links to the list of all articles in a books or proceedings volume.
 * X	 (arXiv e-print)	 Links to on-line articles in the arXiv database.


##**Individual article view**##

Clicking on the bibcode of an individual article will bring you to a page showing the abstract view for the chosen article including a DOI link. On this page you will find tab links to lists of:
 * References in the article
 * Citations to the article
 * Co-reads of the article
 
 In addition you will find links to Full Text Sources and Data Products.   Also shown will be a list of Suggested Articles.  We also provide links to ADS private libraries, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Mendeley.
