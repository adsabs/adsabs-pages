##Normalized paper count## 
For a list of N papers (i=1,…N), where Nauthi is the number of authors for publication i, the normalized paper count is the sum over 1/Nauthi

##Normalized citations## 
For a list of N papers (i=1,…N), where Nauthi is the number of authors for publication i and Ci the number of citations that this paper received, the normalized citation count for each article is Ci/Nauthi, and the 'normalized citations' for this list of N papers is the sum of these N numbers.

##h-index## 
Hirsch's h-index is the largest number H such that H publications have at least H citations. It attempts to measure the productivity and impact of a researcher in a single number. Wikipedia entry

##m-index## 
The m-index is the h-index divided by the time (years) between the first and most recent publication.

##e-index## 

The e-index (see 10.1371/journal.pone.0005429) is calculated (using a citation-sorted list of publications) as

e2 = Σcj - h2

where cj is the number of citations received by paper j, and it represents the ignored excess citations. The sum runs from 1 to h It is not a replacement for h, but to be used in conjunction with h. In other words, for a citation-ordered list of publications, the square of e equals the sum of citations up to the publication with rank h.

##i10-index## is the number of publications with at least 10 citations.

##g-index## Given a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that they received, the g-index is the (unique) largest number such that the top g articles received (together) at least g2 citations. (see 10.1007/s11192-006-0144-7)

##tori-index## The total research impact of a scholar (tori) is calculated using the reference lists of the citing papers, where self-citations are removed. The contribution of each citing paper is then normalized by the number of remaining references in the citing papers and the number of authors in the cited paper. The tori-index is defined as the amount of work that others have devoted to his/her research, measured in research papers.

##riq-index## The research impact quotient (riq) equals the square root of the tori-index, divided by the time between the first and last publication, multiplied by 1000

For both tori and riq, see arXiv:1209.2124
