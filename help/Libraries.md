#**The ADS Libraries System**#

ADS provides you with a way to save and organize bibliographic records in private collections named "ADS Libraries."  
Libraries are used to save papers of interest and attach relevant information to them. For example, you could store your publications, or a set of references to be published in a paper, in a library for later use.  As you add (or "post") papers to a library, you will be given the option of tagging them to facilitate their retrieval or identification later.  In addition, library users can also add free-text annotations to records in their libraries.

As a user, you can create one or more collaborative groups of ADS users and share your library with individual users or groups, and even let them post items to your library.  For example, you could store your research group's or a journal club's reading material, or papers relevant to your research activities, in the group's library.  Each library's owner can decide what access policy applies to a shared library: 
 * read only: members (other than the owner) are granted read privileges, but cannot post records to the library
 * read and post: members can both read the contents of the library and post records to it

In addition to user-created collaborative groups, two groups are pre-defined in the ADS Libraries system:
 * all ADS Users: this group consists of all users who have an ADS account (login)
 * the General Public: libraries made readable to the general public can be viewed by anybody who has the library's url

Users who choose to make a library public can then freely share its url knowing that anybody with the link will be able to see its contents.  This is a useful way to maintain and publish a curated list of papers in ADS, e.g. one's own bibliography.

##**Creating and Using ADS Libraries**##

In order to be able to create libraries and add papers to them, you will first need to log into [ADS 2.0](http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/).  If you already have an account which you created when accessing the main ADS Classic website (http://adsabs.harvard.edu), then you can use the same credentials to log in using ADS 2.0's [user account page](http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/user/).

If you have created libraries in ADS Classic, you will have an option to import them into the new system, but the two library systems will not be kept in sync going forward.  After an initial import, any further changes to the ADS Classic libraries will not be reflected here, unless you re-import the libraries once again.  Similarly, any publications added to libraries here are NOT updated in the ADS Classic libraries.
