###**HOW TO SEARCH THE ADS**###

Our new one box search strings together queries for you.

Preset search options that are available for you include: 
  * **Author** format: lastname, firstname middleinitial
  * **First Author** format: lastname, firstname middleinitial
  * **Title** searches text within title field
  * **Year** format YYYY or range YYYY-YYYY
  * **Publication** Use journal abbreviations from our <A HREF=
  "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/journal.abbr.html"> bibstem list </A>
  * **Fulltext** searches within the fulltext of articles
  
  You can string together any of the search terms to develop a query.  The default operator is AND but can be changed by specifying OR in the query.  Similarly one can exclude a term by prepending a "-" sign to it. [**EXAMPLE**](examples.md#stringing-together-a-query)
  
  The **"+ options"** button allows you to  
  * specify a publication date range to search in between (if you do not know the month you may use "00".)  
  * select a database:  astronomy, physics, general or all
  * disable fulltext (searches only article metadata and not the entire article)
  * select articles only (this excludes documents like observing proposals, catalog descriptions, meeting abstracts and communications)

  
  The **search settings** option allows you to select how many results to return (200 is the default)
