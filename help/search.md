<B>How to search the ADS:</B>

Our new one box search strings together queries for you.

Preset search options that are available for you include: <ul> 
  <li><B>Author</B> format: lastname, firstname middleinitial
  <li><B>First Author</B> format: lastname, firstname middleinitial
  <li><B>Title</B> searches text within title field
  <li><B>Year</B> format YYYY or range YYYY-YYYY
  <li><B>Publication</B> Use journal abbreviations from our [bibstem list <A HREF=
  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/journal.abbr.html</A>]
  <li><B>Fulltext</B> searches within the fulltext of articles
  </ul>
  
  You can string together any of the search terms to develop a query.  The default operator is AND but can be changed by specifying OR in the query.  Similarly one can exclude a term by prepending a "-" sign to it.
  
  The <B>"+ options"</B> button allows you to <ul> 
  <li>specify a publication date range to search in between (if you do not know the month you may use "00".)  
  <li>select a database:  astronomy, physics, general or all
  <li>disable fulltext (searches only article metadata and not the entire article)
  <li> select articles only
  </ul>
  
  The search settings option allows you to select how many results to return (200 is the default)
